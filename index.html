        <h1>What is Magic: the Gathering and what do all the cards do?</h1>
        <div class="introEx">
          <h2>Allow us to explain!</h2>
          <p>
            Magic: The Gathering, also "Magic" or "MTG", is a turn-based
            strategy card game commonly played with two players (though it can
            be played with more). Each player uses their own deck, which may be
            assembled from cards they own, or from a random selection, (e.g.
            booster packs). The "classic" way to win is to reduce your
            opponent's life total to 0; however, over the decades of its
            existence, there have accumulated over 20,000 unique cards, with
            hundreds more being released every year. As a result, this is a game
            of many possibilities! In the interests of brevity (and your
            sanity), we will omit certain subtleties of the rules, but will
            provide a brief introduction that should be enough to get you
            playing.
          </p>
          <h4>General Game Info:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The game starts with each player shuffling their deck (called a
              <em>library</em>) and drawing seven cards
            </li>
            <li>Each player starts with 20 life</li>
            <li>Each player's library typically has 60 cards</li>
            <li>
              Each player's library typically has no more than a few copies of
              any given card
            </li>
            <li>
              Each player draws a card at the beginning of their turn (in a
              two-player game the first player skips the first draw)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Brief Definitions:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Playing</strong> a card means putting it from your hand
              onto the table (called the <em>battlefield</em>). Most cards can
              only be played on their owner's turn.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tapping</strong> a card means taking a card on the
              battlefield (a <em>permanent</em>) and turning it sideways; once a
              card is tapped, it stays tapped until the start of its
              controller's next turn, untapping before they draw.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mana</strong> is a magical resource used to play cards and
              pay for effects. It can be <em>colored</em> (red, green, blue,
              black, white) or <em>colorless</em>. Any card that isn't a land
              will have a <em>mana cost</em> (top-right corner of the card).
              This tells you how much mana you need to pay to play that card,
              and what color that mana needs to be. A plain number indicates
              generic mana, which can be paid with whatever mana. A card's
              <em>color identity</em> is whatever mana colors are in its mana
              cost. If a card has no mana colors in its cost, it is colorless.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a card is <strong>destroyed</strong>, it is put into its
              owner's graveyard. The same is true of a <em>dead</em> or
              <em>sacrificed</em> creature, or of a planeswalker at 0 loyalty.
            </li>
            <li>
              If a card is <strong>exiled</strong>, it is put into its owner's
              exile pile. Exile is far worse than death; while there are many
              cards that resurrect from the graveyard, there are only a small
              handful that return from exile.
            </li>

          <h4>Lands</h4>
          <p>
            Lands represent locations under your control, and are the most
            common way to generate mana. They are a unique card type in several
            ways: they have no mana cost, you may only play one per turn, and --
            if the land is a "basic" land -- you may have any number in your
            library. These are the basic land types and the color of mana they
            make: Mountain (red), Forest (green), Island (blue), Swamp (black),
            Plains (white), Wastes (colorless). Lands almost always require
            tapping to produce mana; however, many lands have unique effects,
            such as letting you choose the type of mana you get from them,
            making multiple mana colors at once, or even effects that have
            nothing to do with mana! Some lands don't make any mana at all, but
            these are rare. The most common types of lands you'll see in play
            are probably those that tap for 1-2 colors, or for "any color".

        <div class="lrgImgContainer"></div>
        <article tabindex="0">
          <h4>Creatures</h4>
          <p>
            Creatures represent warriors, minions, and monsters in your service,
            and are a staple of the game; killing your opponents with damage
            from creatures was the original way to win, early in Magic's
            history, and continues to be one of the most common paths to
            victory. Every creature has a power and toughness (shown in the
            bottom-right corner as "P / T"); Its power represents how much
            damage it deals in combat, and its toughness represents how much
            damage it takes to kill. Creatures are used to attack your opponent
            during your turn's combat phase (you only get one per turn, but you
            can begin it whenever you want); after you declare attackers
            (announcing which of your creatures will attack), your opponent may
            choose to declare some of their own creatures as blockers. When two
            creatures clash in this way, each simultaneously deals damage to the
            other's toughness. This may result in both creatures killing one
            another, both surviving, or one surviving and the other dying. Your
            opponent may choose to block an attacker with more than one blocker;
            in this case, the opponent decides which blockers deal/take damage
            first; your attacker will deal the same damage to each blocker it
            faces, but its toughness will gradually be worn down. If it
            survives, its toughness will "heal" at the end of your turn. When
            you play a creature, it has what is commonly called "summoning
            sickness" until the start of your next turn. Summoning sickness
            prevents the creature from attacking, and from using effects that
            require tapping. Often, creatures will come with one or more
            keywords, such as "haste", "vigilance", "trample", etc. These
            keywords are shorthands for common creature abilities; an FAQ
            section detailing the most common ones is coming soon.

      <section class="explainer" id="Artifact">
        <div class="lrgImgContainer"></div>
        <article tabindex="0">
          <h4>Artifacts</h4>
          <p>
            Arifacts are much more diverse than creatures; they may represent a
            magical item, a piece of equipment, a bauble, a device, or even a
            completely natural object. Some of the artifacts most commonly seen
            in everyday play are called "mana rocks"; these usually cost no more
            than 2-3 mana to play, and typically tap for one mana. This makes
            them similar to lands, but without the "1 per turn" limitation. As a
            result, they are very useful in gaining mana advantage over your
            opponent. Another common type of artifact is "Equipment"; these have
            the unique ability to attach themselves to one of your creatures,
            usually providing said creature with one or more buffs, such as
            increases to its power and/or toughness and sometimes additional
            keywords (FAQ coming soon). Beyond this, artifacts are a very broad
            category; many have unique effects, some of which alter core
            mechanics of the game (usually) in your favor. Most artifacts have a
            purely generic cost, requiring no particular mana color to play; as
            a result, they are a great fit in many decks, and are ubiquitous
            throughout the game.

        <article tabindex="0">
          <h4>Enchantments</h4>
          <p>
            Enchantments represent persistent magical effects. Most have some
            sort of continuous effect, or modify the game rules in some way.
            They are very similar to artifacts in their great variety and
            diversity; the biggest difference is that while most artifacts are
            colorless, all enchantments have a color. Certain types of
            enchantments have specific targets; these are called Auras and
            Curses. Curses are generally harmful enchantments intended to be
            cast on your opponent; Auras can be beneficial or harmful, and may
            be cast on yourself, your opponent, or any card on the battlefield
            belonging to either.

      <section class="explainer" id="Planeswalker">
        <div class="lrgImgContainer"></div>
        <article tabindex="0">
          <h4>Planeswalkers</h4>
          <p>
            Planeswalkers represent specific figures in the story of Magic: the
            Gathering. In this fantasy setting, the universe is actually a
            multiverse consisting of many dimensions called "planes", which
            planeswalkers have the unique ability to travel between (all other
            creatures being stuck in their plane of origin). Indeed, in the lore
            of the game, the players are planeswalkers themselves, channelling
            powerful magic to summon creatures, conjure enchantments, and so on.
            A planeswalker card, then, represents a "fellow" planeswalker whom
            you call to your aid. Despite the fact that planeswalker characters
            are living intelligent beings (humans, elves, &c), planeswalker
            cards do not count as creatures in the game rules. As
            counterintuitive as this is, perhaps a good interpretation is that
            they are "above the common rabble"; they have "agreed to help you
            out", but will not participate in such "low" activities as attacking
            your opponent directly. However, they do offer their services in the
            form of their loyalty. When you play a planeswalker, they enter the
            battlefield with some initial loyalty (shown in the bottom-right of
            the card). Once on each of your turns, you may activate one of their
            loyalty abilities; these will increase or decrease their loyalty by
            the stated amount. A "minus" ability can't be used unless the
            planeswalker actually has at least that much loyalty. Planeswalker
            abilities are as varied and diverse as those of artifacts and
            enchantments; they are often very beneficial, making planeswalkers a
            high-priority target for your opponent. A planeswalker's loyalty is
            decreased if they take damage; in keeping with the game's lore, if
            you control a planeswalker, your opponent may choose for some of
            their creatures to attack at your planeswalker instead of you. You
            may declare blockers accordingly; if a planeswalker ends up being
            damaged, their loyalty is reduced by that amount, similar to your
            own life.

        <article tabindex="0">
          <h4>Instants & Sorceries</h4>
          <p>
            Unlike the preceding card types, instants and sorceries represent
            "spells" in the classic fantasy sense; that is, they are generally a
            one-time, single-use effect. When you play one, instead of going to
            the battlefield, it resolves and then immediately moves to your
            graveyard. The biggest difference between instants and sorceries
            comes down to timing: while sorceries can only be cast on your turn
            (the same as artifacts, enchantments, and planeswalkers), you can
            cast an instant pretty much whenever you want, including on an
            opponent's turn. instants and sorceries are incredibly diverse. Some
            deal damage directly to your opponent's life; others have effects
            such as "destroy all creatures" (called "board wipes", because they
            "wipe the board"); others exist purely to prevent a card from being
            played by your opponent (like the classic "counterspell"). Together,
            instants and sorceries are colloquially called "spells" by the Magic
            community; however, this easily leads to confusion, because the word
            "spell" has a specific meaning in the MTG rules (coming soon).
